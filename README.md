# win32_server.cpp
A simple, efficient and single-threaded TCP server for systems running Windows. May become multi-threaded in the future.

# Understanding the library
You can read our short doc / tutorial [here](https://github.com/XeTute/win32_server.cpp/wiki).

# Example code
This should compile without any errors, and you should be able to see a new used port on your system:
```cpp
#include "win32_server.hpp"

std::string function(std::string i) { return i; }
int main()
{
	TCP_server _socket;

	bool run = true;

	_socket.init(4301);
	_socket._listen();
	_socket._accept(function, &run);
	_socket.kill();

	return 0;
}
```
